Project Overview
Unleash the power of data-driven investment insights!

This Python project is your toolkit for exploring the stock market. We'll fetch historical stock data from Alpha Vantage, transform it into actionable information, and calculate key technical indicators.

Key Features
Data Wizard: Effortlessly grab daily stock data from Alpha Vantage.
Data Cleanup: Transform raw data into a polished dataset ready for analysis.
Technical Insights: Calculate essential indicators like Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands, and RSI.
Export for Exploration: Save your enriched data as a CSV file for deeper analysis.
Tech Stack

We'll use these powerful tools:

1. Python: The programming workhorse.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
3. NumPy: For numerical calculations.
4. Requests: To fetch data from the Alpha Vantage API.
5. Getting Started
6. Let's build something awesome together!

To kickstart your project, you'll need:

1. Python Environment: Ensure you have Python installed. Consider using a virtual environment for project isolation.
2. Required Libraries: Install the necessary libraries using pip install pandas numpy requests.
3. Alpha Vantage API Key: Sign up for a free Alpha Vantage API key at https://www.alphavantage.co/.
4. Basic Understanding: Familiarity with Python, data analysis concepts, and financial markets is helpful.

Running the Project

To run the project and fetch stock data for a specific symbol (e.g., AAPL):

in command prompt: python stock_analysis.py
This will:

Fetch the stock data from Alpha Vantage.
Perform data cleaning and feature engineering.
Save the processed data to a CSV file named after the stock symbol.

Project Structure
stock_analysis.py: Main script that contains the code for fetching, cleaning, and processing the stock data.
README.md: Project documentation.

Example Output
After running the script, you will get a CSV file (e.g., AAPL.csv) with the following columns:

Open: Opening price of the stock.
High: Highest price of the stock for the day.
Low: Lowest price of the stock for the day.
Close: Closing price of the stock.
Volume: Number of shares traded.
SMA_20: 20-day Simple Moving Average.
SMA_50: 50-day Simple Moving Average.
EMA_20: 20-day Exponential Moving Average.
BB_upper: Upper Bollinger Band.
BB_lower: Lower Bollinger Band.
RSI: Relative Strength Index.
